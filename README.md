# ðŸ§® Command-Line Calculator (CLC)

This is a flexible command-line calculator written in C, created as part of a university programming assignment. It supports binary operations (like addition, power, and modulo), unary operations (like square root, log, exponential), and variable definitions for use in advanced calculations.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“Œ **Binary operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `P` (power), `X` (max), `I` (min)
- ðŸ“Œ **Unary operations**: `S` (square root), `L` (log), `E` (exponential), `C` (ceiling), `F` (floor)
- ðŸ“Œ **Advanced mode**: Use variables (`a` to `e`) to store and reuse values
- ðŸ“Œ **Input validation** for invalid operators or unsafe operations (e.g., dividing by zero)
- ðŸ“Œ Clear UI prompts and error messages
- ðŸ“Œ Written entirely in C without external libraries
